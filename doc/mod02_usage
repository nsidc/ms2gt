USAGE: mod02.pl dirinout tag listfile gpdfile chanfile
                [ancilfile [latlon_src [ancil_src [keep [rind]]]]]
       defaults:   none          1          1       0     50

  dirinout: directory containing the input and output files.
  tag: string used as a prefix to output files.
  listfile: text file containing a list of MOD02 or MOD03 files to be gridded.
        All files in listfile must be of the same type (MOD02 or MOD03) and
        the same resolution.
  gpdfile: .gpd file that defines desired output grid.
  chanfile: text file containing a list of channels to be gridded, one line
        per channel. If chanfile is \"none\" then no channel data will be
        gridded and ancilfile must not be \"none\". Each line in chanfile
        should consist of up to four fields:
          chan conversion weight_type fill
            where the fields are defined as follows:
              chan - specifies a channel number (1-36).
              conversion - a string that specifies the type of conversion
                that should be performed on the channel. The string must be
                one of the following:
                  raw - raw HDF values (16-bit unsigned integers) (default).
                  corrected - corrected counts (floating-point).
                  radiance - watts per square meter per steradian per
                    micrometer (floating-point).
                  reflectance - (channels 1-19 and 26) reflectance without
                    solar zenith angle correction (floating-point).
                  temperature - (channels 20-25 and 27-36) brightness
                    temperature in kelvin (floating-point).
              weight_type - a string that specifies the type of weighting
                that should be perfomed on the channel. The string must be one
                of the following:
                  avg - use weighted averaging (default).
                  max - use maximum weighting.
              fill - specifies the output fill value. Default is 0.
  NOTE: if first file in listfile is MOD03, then chanfile must be \"none\",
        and both latlon_src and ancil_src are forced to 3.
  ancilfile: text file containing a list of ancillary parameters to be gridded,
        one line per parameter. The default is \"none\" indicating that no
        ancillary parameters should be gridded. Each line in ancilfile should
        consist of up to four fields:
          param conversion weight_type fill
            where the fields are defined as follows:
              param - a string that specifies an ancillary parameter to be
                gridded, and must be one of the following 4 character strings:
                  hght - Height
                  seze - SensorZenith
                  seaz - SensorAzimuth
                  rang - Range
                  soze - SolarZenith
                  soaz - SolarAzimuth
                  lmsk - Land/SeaMask (available in MOD03 only)
                  gflg - gflags
              conversion - a string that specifies the type of conversion
                that should be performed on the channel. The string must be
                one of the following:
                  raw - raw HDF values (16-bit signed integers except that
                    Range is 16-bit unsigned integer and Land/SeaMask and
                    gflags are unsigned bytes) (default).
                  scaled - raw values multiplied by a parameter-specific
                    scale factor (floating-point). Note that scale factor
                    for Height, Land/SeaMask, and gflags is 1.
              weight_type - a string that specifies the type of weighting
                that should be perfomed on the channel. The string must be one
                of the following:
                  avg - use weighted averaging (default for all except
                        Land/SeaMask and gflags).
                  max - use maximum weighting (default for Land/SeaMask and
                        gflags).
              fill - specifies the output fill value. Default is 0.
  latlon_src: 1: use 5 km lat-lon data from MOD021KM file (default).
              3: use 1 km lat-lon data from MOD03 file.
              H: use 1 km lat-lon data from MOD02HKM file.
              Q: use 1 km lat-lon data from MOD02QKM file.
  NOTE: if latlon_src is set to 3, then ancil_src is forced to 3.
  ancil_src: 1: use 5 km ancillary data from MOD021KM file (default).
             3: use 1 km ancillary data from MOD03 file.
  NOTE: if ancil_src is set to 3, then latlon_src is forced to 3.
  keep: 0: delete intermediate chan, lat, lon, col, and row files (default).
        1: do not delete intermediate chan, lat, lon, col, and row files.
  rind: number of pixels to add around intermediate grid to eliminate
        holes in final grid. Default is 50.\n\n";
