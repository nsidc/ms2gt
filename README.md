# MODIS Swath-to-Grid Toolkit

The MODIS Swath-to-Grid Toolbox (MS2GT) is a set of software tools that
can be used to read HDF-EOS files containing MODIS swath data and produce
flat binary files containing gridded data in a variety of map
projections. Multiple input files corresponding to successively acquired 5
minute MODIS "scenes" can be processed together to produce a seamless
output grid.

MS2GT consists of four perl programs that make calls to several
standalone IDL and C programs: mod02.pl which reads MOD02 Level 1b files,
mod10_l2.pl which reads MOD10_L2 snow cover files, mod29.pl which
reads MOD29 sea ice files, and mod35_l2 which reads MOD35_L2 cloud mask
files. All four Perl programs can optionally read MOD03 files for
geolocation and/or ancillary data.

## Installation

See the [MS2GT page](https://nsidc.org/data/modis/ms2gt) for information on how to build and install the toolkit.  Note that the documentation was written for v0.5 and have not been updated since.  Note that the documentation there refers to downloading the v0.5 package from the FTP site.  If using this repository, you do not need to do that, you can simply clone this repository into a folder and run the [Building the Executables](https://nsidc.org/data/modis/ms2gt#building) step from there.

## Usage

See the [Tutorials](https://nsidc.org/data/modis/ms2gt/tutorials.html) for information on using the tools in the toolkit.  Note that these tutorials were written for v0.5, and have not been updated since.  Changes that apply to later versions may not be covered.

The instructions on that page will refer you to data on an FTP site.  This repository also has the data in the relevant `tutorial_x` folder.
